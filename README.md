## Introduction:
 The Entopia architecture is a combination of two different apps: the Entech and the Playtopia app. The architecture aims to provide a comprehensive platform that serves the needs of students and gamers alike.
 
The Entech app aims to track students and colleges to help with processes such as student identification, tracking AICTE approved colleges, and distributing fellowships, grants, and training. The app eliminates the need for carrying verified documents or ID proofs and has a feature for detecting criminal records of students. The app also includes an embedded marketplace for students and sponsored videos from reputed institutions for training and improving skills. It helps students by sorting out jobs based on eligibility criteria.
 
The Playtopia app provides users with different perspectives for generating income by streaming and selling. It offers a variety of game levels and challenges that improve a player's aim and accuracy, including target practice sessions and gameplay that demands dexterity and accuracy. The app includes an in-app facemesh streaming feature that tracks facial movement to help users concentrate on the screen. Users can stream their own gaming for others to watch while also watching live streaming of other gamers practicing and competing. The app also includes a one-click sponsorship feature through which gamers can connect with sponsors by sharing their gaming statistics reports via mail with just a click.

Together, the Entech app and the Playtopia app make up the Entopia architecture, which provides students and gamers with a comprehensive platform that caters to their needs. The architecture aims to provide convenience, ease of use, and a sense of community for its users.
